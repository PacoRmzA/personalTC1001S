# personalTC1001S
Personal repo for work in TC1001S by Francisco José Ramírez Aldaco. It consists of a single program, `act_convolucion.py`, which implements convolution as seen in class, as well as extend-type padding for the edges of the image.

### Usage
To use this program, add the desired images to the project directory, change line 5 of the code to the path of the image to be selected, and change lines 6 (kernel) and 60 (divisor) if a new kernel is to be implemented. When run, the code displays the original image and the filtered image in 2 separate windows. To close them, press 'q'.

### Dependencies
This program uses OpenCV and NumPy to apply the filter to the image.
